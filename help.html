<p>Rsampling is a free and open source package intended for teaching and learning about 
	resampling in statistics. It is heavily based on the
	<a href="http://www.resample.com">Resampling Stats</a>.</p>
<p>We may summarize the logic behind a significance test as follows:
<ul><li>Determine your statistic of interest</li>
		 <li>Determine your null hypothesis</li>
		 <li>Obtain the distribution of your statistic of interest under the null hypothesis</li>
		 <li>Reject the null hypothesis if the probability of the observed statistic of interest under the
		 null hypothesis is under a certain threshold</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind this package is to help students to understand the logic behind these tests,
	 with lots of flexibility on what is the statistic that will be calculated.</p>
